## 🧱 Module 1: Set up a Web Page with HTML

### 🔹 Key Concepts

#### 📄 HTML Document Structure

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type.
* `<html>`: Root of the HTML page.
* `<head>`: Contains metadata, styles, and scripts.
* `<body>`: Contains visible page content.

#### 🔖 Tags and Elements

* Elements are made of opening and closing tags.
* Example: `<em>I’m emphasized</em>` wraps text to add emphasis.
* Browsers interpret tags but don't display them—only their effects.

#### 🧳 Nesting Elements

* Like packing small bags into a suitcase: parent/child structure.
* Example:

  ```html
  <div>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
  </div>
  ```

#### 📐 Syntax and Semantics

* Syntax = Rules of the language.
* Semantics = Meaning or purpose of tags (e.g., `<em>` for emphasis, `<strong>` for importance).

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<p>`            | Paragraph of text                                       |
| `<h1>` to `<h6>` | Headings (h1 is largest/most important)                 |
| `<a>`            | Hyperlink to another page or section                    |
| `<span>`         | Inline element for styling specific text                |
| `<blockquote>`   | Long quotations from external sources                   |
| `<br>`           | Line break (no closing tag)                             |
| `<img>`          | Display an image (use `src` for image URL)              |
| `<hr>`           | Horizontal line for section separation (no closing tag) |

Example:

```html
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Example image">
```
