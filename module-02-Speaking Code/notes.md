# Module 2: Speaking Code - Notes

## Introduction

In this module, we explored abstraction and its role in computer programming. We also examined different types of programming languages and how code is translated into machine instructions.

### Learning Objectives:

* Understand the concept of abstraction.
* Identify different types of programming languages.
* Learn how computers read code.
* Understand the compilation process.

## Abstraction in Computer Programming

* Abstraction hides complex system details so developers can focus on essential parts.
* Example: Driving a car without knowing how the engine works.
* Similar to coding: We don’t need to use binary (0s and 1s); we use high-level languages instead.

### Everyday Examples of Abstraction

* Smartphone: Tap icons to send messages.
* Microwave: Heat food with button presses.
* Washing machine: Select a cycle, and it handles the rest.
* Coffee machine, toaster, vending machines.

## Types of Programming Languages

### 1. Machine Language

* Made up of binary (0s and 1s).
* Directly understood by the CPU.
* Rarely used today.

### 2. Compiled Languages

* Examples: C, C++, Java, C#.
* Code is converted to machine code using a **compiler**.
* Loaded into memory and executed as a whole.
* Faster execution but harder to modify after compilation.

### 3. Interpreted Languages

* Examples: Python, JavaScript.
* Code is executed **line-by-line** using an **interpreter**.
* Easier to debug and modify.
* Most abstract and human-readable.

## How a Computer Reads Code

* Computers only understand binary (on/off or 0/1).
* Early programmers used punch cards.
* Today, human-readable code is translated into machine code using compilers or interpreters.

### Compilation Process:

1. **Syntax Check** – Verifies the code is written correctly.
2. **Translation** – Converts code to machine language.
3. **Execution** – Computer runs the translated instructions.

## Key Terms:

* **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity.
* **Source Code**: Human-readable code written by developers.
* **Compiler**: Converts source code to machine code.
* **Interpreter**: Executes code line-by-line.
* **Syntax**: Structure and rules of a programming language.
