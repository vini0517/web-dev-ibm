# Module 5: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Concepts

## Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior such as learning patterns and making predictions. It is transforming industries by automating complex tasks and enhancing decision-making.

## Key Concepts

- **Narrow AI**: Specialized in a single task (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation engines).
- **General AI (Broad AI)**: Capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do.
- **Augmented Intelligence**: AI systems designed to enhance human intelligence rather than replace it.

## Applications

- Predicting weather and pandemics
- Enhancing business decision-making
- Self-driving cars

## Eras of Computing

1. **Tabulation Era**: Focused on counting and organizing data.
2. **Programming Era**: Enabled logic, instructions, and software programs.
3. **AI Era**: Introduced machine learning, predictive modeling, and adaptive systems.

## Challenges

- Unrealistic expectations leading to AI winters
- Data bias and ethical considerations
- Need for transparency and explainability
