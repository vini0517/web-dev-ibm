## Overview of Front-End Development

* **Focus**: Developing parts of a website users can see and interact with
* **Runs On**: User's device (client-side)
* **Primary Focus**:

  * Website layout
  * Visual design elements
* **Relation to Data**: Enables user input and interaction

### Programming Priorities:

## Evolution

* Early sites: Informational with simple layouts
* Today: Advanced interactions, animations, and 3D rendering

### Areas of Focus for Modern Front-End Developers:

#### 1. Mobile Ready

* Metadata in headers must match content in body
* Improves crawlability and visibility

#### 3. Accessibility

* Support for screen readers
* High-contrast and dark modes
* Touchscreen compatibility

## Challenges in Front-End Development

* **Technical Demands**: Balancing design and technical constraints
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Different browsers support different features
* **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure limited functionality on older browsers
