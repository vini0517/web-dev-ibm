# Module 1 Recap: Web Browsers and Markup

## Overview

This module introduces how web browsers and markup languages like HTML work together to create and display web content. It highlights the role of web developers in designing web pages that are functional, accessible, and optimized for different devices and conditions.

## Key Concepts

### 🌐 What Web Browsers Do
- Web browsers allow users to **view and exchange information** with websites.
- Browsers interpret **markup languages** (like HTML) to render content such as text, images, and links in a human-readable format.
- Examples of browsers: **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, **Microsoft Edge**, **Safari**.

### 🧩 What is Markup?
- Markup provides **instructions** to browsers on **how to display** content.
- It is **text-based** and uses tags like `<b>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
- Example: `<b>Developing for the web is fun</b>` becomes **bold text** when rendered.

## 🛠️ Challenges Addressed by Markup

### 1. **Bandwidth**
- **Text-based** markup uses less bandwidth.
- Linking to external resources (like images) avoids embedding large files directly.

### 2. **Embedding**
- Embedding makes documents large and hard to transmit.
- Markup solves this by **linking** to external files instead of embedding them.

### 3. **Openness**
- Markup (e.g., HTML) is **open and non-proprietary**.
- Accessible to everyone regardless of the platform or tools.

## 💡 Rendering
- **Rendering** is the process where browsers **interpret markup** and **display** it visually for users.

## ✅ Considerations for Web Developers
- **Different screen sizes**: Make sure content looks good on both mobile and desktop.
- **Data storage**: Understand how browsers on different devices store data.
- **Browser capabilities**: Not all browsers support every feature — plan accordingly.
