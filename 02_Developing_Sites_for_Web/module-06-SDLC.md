# Module 6: From Requirements to Launch

## Introduction
This module covers the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** and its six common phases related to web development. It also compares **waterfall and agile approaches**, with an overview of the **scrum framework**.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify common phases in the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
- Compare waterfall and agile approaches to development
- Highlight the components of the Scrum framework

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### Definition
A **framework for building high-quality software/websites** that meet user needs. It includes a set of standard steps with deliverables.

### Six Phases of SDLC

1. **Planning**
   - Gather requirements from stakeholders
   - Define website goals and purpose
   - Identify audience and content

2. **Design**
   - Plan sitemap, navigation structure, and information architecture
   - Consider layout, brand elements, and content planning

3. **Development**
   - Build the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Use wireframes and design outputs

4. **Testing**
   - Test for functionality, usability, accessibility
   - Confirm all features work as planned

5. **Launch**
   - Publish files to the server and go live

6. **Maintenance**
   - Update based on feedback, support, and tech advancements
   - Refresh content and media

## Waterfall vs Agile

### Waterfall Approach
- Linear, phase-by-phase
- Disadvantages:
  - Long cycle times
  - Minimal user feedback
  - Delayed issue detection

### Agile Approach
- Developed in response to Waterfall issues
- Based on 4 values from the Agile Manifesto:
  1. Individuals and interactions over processes/tools
  2. Working software over documentation
  3. Customer collaboration over contracts
  4. Responding to change over following a plan

- Enables **faster development** and **incremental delivery**

## Scrum Framework (Agile Implementation)

### Scrum Teams
- Small, focused teams working toward a common goal

### Sprints
- Time-boxed work cycles (e.g., 2 weeks)
- Full dev lifecycle in each sprint
- Include:
  - **Sprint planning**
  - **Sprint backlog**
  - **Sprint review & retrospective**

### Ceremonies
- **Sprint planning**
- **Daily scrum / stand-ups**
- **Sprint reviews / demos**
- **Sprint retrospectives**

> **Note:** Scrum â‰  Agile. Scrum is just one method to implement Agile principles. Other methods: **Kanban**, **Extreme Programming (XP)**

## Summary Matching (SDLC Tasks)

- **Planning**: Gather requirements, define goals
- **Design**: Organize content, create sitemap
- **Development**: Write HTML/CSS, apply branding
- **Testing**: Confirm requirements, check accessibility
