## 📘 **Module 2: Tracking and Managing Code Changes**

### 🧭 Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn how web developers use **version control systems (VCS)** to:
🔹 Track and manage code changes
🔹 Understand how version control works
🔹 Use features like repositories, commits, merges, and deployment

---

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

* 🕵️‍♂️ Identify the system used to track and manage code
* 🔧 Describe key features of version control systems
* 🧠 Explain how version control systems work
* 🧑‍💻 Describe typical developer workflows using VCS

---

### 📚 **Introduction to Version Control Systems**

Imagine writing a group project before computers 📖:

* ✅ One notebook, one editor at a time
* 🖊️ Different colored pens to track contributors
* 📝 A changelog for all edits

That’s version control in a nutshell!

💡 Early VCS Example: **SCCS (Source Code Control System)**

* Stores all versions in one file 📂
* Adds version numbers, dates, and authors 🗓️✍️
* Keeps a delta log of changes 📜

### 🛠️ **Features of Version Control Systems**

#### 📁 Code Repository

Like a digital bookshelf for your code — stores **all versions** of your project in one place.

#### 👥 Collaboration Tools

* Comment on code 💬
* Add documentation like README files 📄
* Use project boards, discussions, or chat for teamwork 🤝

#### 🚀 Code Deployment

* Deploy to **staging environment** for testing 🔍
* Then deploy to **live environment** 🌐
* Use **Continuous Deployment (CD)** to automate testing and push updates ⚙️✅

### 🔍 **How Does a Version Control System Work?**

Imagine three chefs 🍪🥭🍯 collaborating on a recipe book:

#### 📄 Step-by-step Analogy:

* ✏️ Each gets a copy to work on individually
* 🔀 They return and compare notes
* ✅ Accept or merge changes
* ❌ Resolve conflicts (e.g., if multiple versions of same recipe part)

This mirrors how developers use **branches, commits, merges**, and **conflict resolution**.

### 💻 **Real Developer Workflow with Git-like VCS**

#### 🔁 Step 1: Clone

📥 `Clone` the remote repo to your local machine to start working.

#### 📥 Step 2: Fetch

🧲 `Fetch` the latest changes from the remote repo to stay updated.

#### 💾 Step 3: Commit

📝 `Commit` your changes with a clear message (like saving a snapshot of progress).

#### 🔀 Step 4: Pull Request

📩 Create a `Pull Request` to propose your changes and get feedback from teammates.

#### 📤 Step 5: Push

🚀 `Push` your finalized code to the remote repo to make it official.
