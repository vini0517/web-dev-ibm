**Course Title: Website Testing and Deployment**

---

### **About This Course**

Welcome to the Website Testing and Deployment course! In this course, you will explore how developers thoroughly test websites to ensure a great, reliable, and responsive user experience. You’ll learn about managing website changes with version control systems, publishing a website, using continuous deployment and continuous delivery, and applying the development operations (DevOps) approach. You’ll also learn about the services and tools web developers use to test and automate the deployment of their websites to servers or the cloud.

### **Module 1: Website Testing**

#### **Introduction**

In this module, you’ll get an overview of website testing. You’ll explore the different types of tests developers perform before they launch their websites and the different areas that need testing. And you’ll get an overview of the typical testing process and how automation can simplify the process for larger systems.

#### **Learning Objectives**

* Describe the purpose of website testing
* Differentiate between the types of website testing
* Identify the areas of a website to consider during testing
* List the typical steps to test a website
* Describe the advantages of automated testing

#### **Introduction to Website Testing**

Trying to use a website that doesn’t work well can be very frustrating. Testing is critical when developers launch a website, make major changes, or even minor updates.

#### **Looking for Bugs**

* Bugs are flaws in code causing crashes or incorrect behavior.
* Not all flaws are bugs; some relate to design or user experience.

#### **Types of Website Testing**

* **Acceptance Tests**: Entire system testing before launch.
* **Integration Tests**: Ensuring components work together (e.g., API communication).
* **Unit Tests**: Smallest testable part (e.g., menu behavior).
* **Functional Tests**: Simulating real-world user scenarios.
* **Performance Tests**: Testing under realistic loads.
* **Regression Tests**: Ensuring new features don't break old ones.
* **Stress Tests**: Testing under extreme conditions.
* **Usability Tests**: Verifying user experience quality.

#### **Areas to Test**

* **User Interface (UI)**: Layout, element interaction, styling.
* **Responsive Design**: Adaptability to screen sizes and orientation angles (alpha, beta, gamma).
* **Code**: Ensure both custom and open-source code are tested.
* **API**: Secure and correct data exchange.
* **Database**: Performance and proximity to server.

#### **Website Testing in Practice**

* **Why is testing a priority?** Prevent brand damage, improve UX, reduce long-term cost.

##### **Common Testing Process**

1. **Define the Test Environment**: Replica of live site, internal access only.
2. **Develop Test Cases**: Steps to verify functionality.
3. **Write and Run Scripts**: Automate repetitive tests.
4. **Analyze Test Results**: Compare expected vs actual outcomes.
5. **Submit Bug Reports**: Document, reproduce, and fix errors.

#### **How Can Automation Help?**

* Saves time
* Improves accuracy
* Detects subtle bugs
* Tests various scenarios (e.g., screen sizes, cloud-based changes)
