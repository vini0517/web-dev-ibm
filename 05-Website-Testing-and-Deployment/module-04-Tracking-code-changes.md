## 📘 Module 2: Tracking and Managing Code Changes

### 🧭 Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn how web developers use version control systems (VCS) to:

* Track and manage code changes
* Understand how version control works
* Use features like repositories, commits, merges, and deployment

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

* Identify the system used to track and manage code
* Describe key features of version control systems
* Explain how version control systems work
* Describe typical developer workflows using a version control system

---

### 📚 Introduction to Version Control Systems

Imagine writing a group project before computers:

* One notebook, one editor at a time
* Different colored pens to track contributors
* A changelog for all edits

This is how version control worked in early days.

**Example: SCCS (Source Code Control System)**

* Stores all versions in one file
* Adds version numbers, dates, and authors
* Keeps a delta log of changes

### 🛠️ Features of Version Control Systems

#### 📁 Code Repository

A centralized place to store the entire project with full version history.

#### 👥 Collaboration Tools

Tools for communication, documentation, and planning in team projects.

#### 🚀 Code Deployment

Deploy code to staging and live environments, often using Continuous Deployment (CD).

---

### 🔍 How Does a Version Control System Work?

Developers work on separate copies of code and later merge changes into a shared project. Conflicts are resolved during merging.

### 💻 Real Developer Workflow with a Git-like VCS

#### 🔁 Step 1: Clone

Copy the remote repository to your local computer.

#### 📥 Step 2: Fetch

Get the latest changes from the remote repository without applying them.

#### 💾 Step 3: Commit

Save a snapshot of your code with a message describing what you changed.

#### 🔀 Step 4: Pull Request

Submit your changes for review before merging them into the main project.

#### 📤 Step 5: Push

Upload your local commits to the remote repository.
