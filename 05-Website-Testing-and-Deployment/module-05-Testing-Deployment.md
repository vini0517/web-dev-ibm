## 🛠️ Module 5: Services and Tools for Testing and Deployment

### 📖 Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn about services and tools web developers use for website testing and deployment. You’ll explore virtualization services, runtime testing tools, and automation tools for deployment.

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

* Differentiate between containers and virtual machines
* Explain how virtual machines help web developers test websites
* Describe types of runtime tools to test and debug websites
* Describe common tools and services used to automate website deployment

### 🧪 Testing Tools and Services

Testing and deployment require careful work. Many tools and services help developers ensure their websites work well before going live.

---

### 🖥️ Virtualization

#### 🥚 Containers

Containers are small software bundles that include only the essential parts of an operating system to run specific code efficiently.

#### 💻 Virtual Machines (VMs)

VMs mimic entire computers, including hardware and OS, allowing developers to run full environments on a single machine.

#### 🔄 Using Containers and VMs to Control Environments

Developers use containers and VMs to create secure, controlled testing environments, isolating sensitive data or simulating real-world conditions.

#### 🧹 Using Containers and VMs for Clean Machine Testing

VMs help developers create clean environments that remove other software variables, enabling focused testing, especially for browser compatibility.

---

### 🔧 Runtime Tools

#### 🔍 Browser Developer Tools

All major browsers have built-in tools to inspect, debug, and modify websites live.

#### 🛠️ API Testing Tools

Tools like Postman let developers test data transfer and security of API calls using methods like GET and POST.

#### ⚡ Performance Testing Tools

Tools such as Google Lighthouse and GTmetrix measure website performance using metrics like First Contentful Paint, Speed Index, and Time to Interactive.

---

### 🚀 Deployment Tools and Services

#### 💻 Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Developers use CLI tools to automate deployment processes, often running batch files or scripts.

#### 🔗 Code Integration

Continuous integration tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and IBM UrbanCode help teams merge code and automate deployment testing.

#### ⏰ Scheduling Tools

Scheduling features allow automation of deployments and tests at set times, improving reliability.

#### 🗺️ Blueprinting

Graphical blueprints show deployment steps and allow engineers to customize processes, e.g., IBM UrbanCode or GitHub Workflow Visualizer.

#### ☁️ Cloud-Based Tools

Cloud providers offer integrated deployment tools and support for open-source tools, making cloud deployment simpler and easier to monitor.
