## 🌐 **Module 3: Delivering a Website to Users**

---

### 📘 **Introduction**

In this module, you’ll learn how websites are published and delivered to users. You’ll explore:

* The difference between **continuous delivery** and **continuous deployment**
* The benefits of **DevOps**
* The **DevOps lifecycle**
* The **shift-left approach** in modern development

---

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

You should be able to:

* Identify how to **publish a website**
* Differentiate between **continuous delivery** and **continuous deployment**
* Explain **DevOps** and its benefits
* Describe the **six workflows** in the DevOps lifecycle
* Understand the **shift-left** approach in DevOps

---

### 📖 **Introduction to Website Publishing**

Publishing a website is like publishing a book 📚 — the goal is to make it available to the right audience.

In web terms:

* **Users** are the target audience of the site (can be public or internal)
* **Publishing** = moving a website from *development* to *accessible by users*

---

### 🧩 **What You Need to Publish a Website**

Like throwing a party 🎉, you need:

* **Content** (decorations/food = text, images, media)
* **Users** (guest list = target audience)
* **Location** (venue = server or cloud hosting)

---

### 🛠️ **Three Phases of Website Publishing**

#### 1. **Prepare**

* Choose hosting (on-premise or cloud)
* Register and configure domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
* Set up security (e.g., SSL certificate for e-commerce)

#### 2. **Set Up**

* Upload all website files
* Test in a **staging environment** to catch issues before going live

#### 3. **Deliver**

* Move website to production (live) environment
* Enable features (e.g., domain, e-commerce)
* Use tools to automate the transition

---

### 🚀 **Introduction to Deployment**

Instead of launching everything at once, modern websites **deploy** smaller updates regularly.

> Think of it like hosting frequent, smaller gatherings instead of one big party.

---

### 🔄 **Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment**

#### **Continuous Delivery**

* Code is always ready for release
* Features are tested in **QA environments**
* Requires **manual approval** to go live
* 🧠 Benefit: Faster testing and earlier feedback

#### **Continuous Deployment**

* Code updates are released **automatically** to users
* Relies on **automated tests**
* No manual steps after testing
* ⚡ Benefit: Fastest delivery to users with minimal delays

---

### ⚙️ **What is DevOps?**

**DevOps** = Development + Operations
A collaborative approach to deliver high-quality websites faster.

#### Why DevOps?

* Reduces silos between development, testing, and operations
* Encourages **automation**, **collaboration**, and **continuous improvement**

#### DevOps Benefits:

* Faster response to feedback
* Improved quality and reliability
* Cost reduction through automation
* Consistent deployments across environments

---

### 🔁 **The DevOps Lifecycle**

The DevOps process is a **repeatable cycle** with 6 core workflows:

1. **Planning**: Define features based on user feedback → create a prioritized **backlog**
2. **Development**: Code and test new features locally
3. **Integration**: Merge and test new code with existing codebase
4. **Deployment**: Push code to staging, test, and gradually release to users
5. **Operations**: Monitor performance, availability, and stability
6. **Learning**: Gather user feedback → cycle back to planning

🧪 **Ongoing**: Testing, security, and compliance happen **throughout** all stages.

---

### 🧭 **DevOps and the Shift-Left Approach**

> Shift-left = move testing and other critical tasks **earlier** in the workflow

Why it matters:

* Prevents critical issues later in development
* Improves security, stability, and user trust

#### Focus Areas:

* **Continuous Testing**: Perform tests as code is written (unit, integration, peer reviews)
* **Security**: Build in from the start to reduce vulnerabilities
* **Compliance**: Ensure legal and regulatory requirements are met early on

---

### ✅ **Summary**

* Publishing a website involves preparation, setup, and delivery
* Deployment improves the process by allowing **frequent updates**
* DevOps improves collaboration and speeds up development
* Shift-left ensures testing, security, and compliance are not afterthoughts
