### 🧾 **Module 2: The JavaScript Programming Model** — Review Summary

---

#### ✅ Strengths:

* Good use of analogies (kitchen, fish, login forms).
* Clear step-by-step buildup from spaghetti code to OOP and functional programming.
* Realistic examples like the Login class and event-based logic.
* Nicely contrasts object-oriented and functional paradigms in JavaScript.

| 📍 Issue                                | 🔎 Details                                                                                    | 💡 Suggested Fix                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Missing Images**                   | Several references like *“The following image shows…”* have no diagrams included.             | Add diagrams or replace with descriptive text.                     |
| **2. Malformed Bullets**                | “• •” and inconsistent list formatting in the final section.                                  | Reformat bullet points cleanly.                                    |
| **3. Function vs Method Clarification** | “While functions are not associated with objects, methods are.” — Technically oversimplified. | Update to reflect that methods are functions attached to objects.  |
| **4. Spaghetti Code Example**           | Infinite loop logic is correct but could be clearer.                                          | Add a one-line clarification on why lines 40 and 50 never execute. |
| **5. Encapsulation Sentence**           | “The object isn’t modifiable, but the function of the object can be modified.” is vague.      | Rephrase to clarify what exactly can or cannot be modified.        |
