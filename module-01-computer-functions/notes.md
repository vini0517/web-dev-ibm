# 📘 Module 1: How Does a Computer Work?

## 🖥️ Four Basic Functions of a Computer

1. **Input**
   - Data received through devices like keyboards, mice, touchscreens, microphones, sensors
   - Translated into binary code (0s and 1s)

2. **Processing**
   - Transforms binary data into useful actions
   - Controlled by software instructions (e.g., user code, OS)

3. **Output**
   - Results displayed via screens, audio, printers, etc.
   - Devices decode machine code into human-understandable format

4. **Storage**
   - **Short-term (Volatile):** Stored in RAM, lost when power is off
     - E.g., form data before submission
   - **Long-term (Persistent):** Stored on HDD, SSD, or cookies
     - E.g., session data, login info, visit history

## 🧱 Computer Architecture Layers

- **Hardware:** Physical components (CPU, RAM, Monitor, Mouse)
- **Input/Output Devices:** Receive/send data (keyboard, microphone, speaker, etc.)
- **Software:**
  - **Operating System (OS):** Manages hardware, user interaction, and software coordination (e.g., Windows, Linux)
  - **Applications:** Programs for specific tasks (e.g., browser, editor)

## 🌐 Connecting Computers & Web Development

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) use code written by web developers
- Browsers are like vehicles; developers provide the "driver" (web pages/apps)

## 📱 Web Apps vs Web Pages

| Feature       | Web Page           | Web Application       |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Behavior      | Mostly static      | Interactive, dynamic   |
| Access        | Via browser        | Via browser or wrapper |
| System Access | Limited            | More (storage, GPU, etc.) |

## 💡 Real-World Scenario

In a currency converter app:
- If the amount entered stays but the result doesn’t display:
  - **Output function** has failed (input and storage work)
