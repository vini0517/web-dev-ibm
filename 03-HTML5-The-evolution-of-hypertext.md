# HTML5: The Evolution of Hypertext

## Module 3: Summary Notes

### Introduction

This module covers the major improvements introduced with HTML5, focusing on document structure, data management, interactivity, and the importance of browser support.

### Learning Objectives

* Identify improvements HTML5 introduced to web development and users
* Recognize the need for browsers to support HTML5

---

### Big Changes with HTML5

Before HTML5, interactivity and media required third-party tools like Flash. HTML5 replaced many of these external dependencies by building interactivity and media capabilities directly into the browser.

#### Example Improvements:

* Drag-and-drop features
* Auto-save capabilities
* Embedded multimedia (images, video, audio) without plug-ins

#### Flash Limitations:

* Not mobile-friendly
* Security vulnerabilities
* Required browser plug-in

HTML5 resolved these issues using native support with JavaScript and CSS.

### General Improvements in HTML5

#### Semantic Structure:

* Introduction of semantic tags like `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<section>`
* More meaningful layout and organization of content

#### Benefits:

* Better user experience
* Easier maintenance
* Improved accessibility
* Cleaner and more readable code

#### HTML vs. HTML5:

* HTML5 separates content (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript)
* Promotes modular and structured development

### Data and Connectivity

#### Before HTML5:

* Manual data submission
* Page refreshes for updates

#### HTML5 Enhancements:

* Auto-save functionality
* Local storage and session storage support
* Real-time data communication (e.g., WebSockets)

#### Frameworks Built on HTML5:

* React (Meta)
* Vue.js (Evan You)

---

### Interactivity

* HTML5 allows embedding graphics and video without plug-ins
* Supports geolocation APIs for mobile integration
* Enables creation of dynamic, app-like web experiences

---

### Web Applications (Web Apps)

* Web apps are full-featured applications accessible via browser
* Capable of performing like desktop apps

---

### Browser Support for HTML5

* HTML5 requires active support from browsers to function effectively
* Specification is broad and constantly evolving
* Different browsers may support different parts of the spec

#### Developer Best Practices:

* Stay current on HTML and browser developments
* Use testing tools to ensure cross-browser compatibility
* Monitor browser updates and HTML5 revisions regularly
